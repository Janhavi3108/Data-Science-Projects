Brain Tumour Detection using EfficientNet B3 & B6

A web-based tool that detects brain tumors and categorizes brain MRIs as
meningioma, glioma, pituitary, or no tumours.
Preprocessing procedures such as Grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur effect, and Thresholding are used, followed by morphological operations and
contour-based segmentation and the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been used as the working model with EfficientNet B3 & B6 architecture.

EfficientNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that has been designed to be computationally efficient while still achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on image classification tasks.
It is based on a new approach to scaling neural networks, called compound scaling, which involves scaling the networkâ€™s depth, width, and resolution simultaneously using a compound coefficient. 

The model can classify different types of brain tumors with an accuracy rate of 96.73%
